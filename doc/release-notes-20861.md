Updated RPCs
------------

- Due to [BIP 350](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0350.mediawiki)
  being implemented, behavior for all RPCs that accept addresses is changed when
  a native witness version 1 (or higher) is passed. These now require a Bech32m
  encoding instead of a Bech32 one, and Bech32m encoding will be used for such
  addresses in RPC output as well. No version 1 addresses should be created
  for mainnet until consensus rules are adopted that give them meaning
  (e.g. through [BIP 341](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki)).
  Once that happens, Bech32m is expected to be used for them, so this shouldn't
  affect any production systems, but may be observed on other networks where such
  addresses already have meaning (like signet).
