## Wallet

- Backwards compatibility has been dropped for two `getaddressinfo` RPC
  deprecations, as notified in the 0.20 release notes. The deprecated `label`
  field has been removed as well as the deprecated `labels` behavior of
  returning a JSON object containing `name` and `purpose` key-value pairs. Since
  0.20, the `labels` field returns a JSON array of label names. (#19200)
