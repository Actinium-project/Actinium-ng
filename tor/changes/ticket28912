  o Major bugfixes (relay, directory):
    - A connection serving directory information wouldn't get reactivated after
      the first chunk of data was sent (usually 32KB). Tor now always activate
      the main loop event that goes through these connections as long as at
      least one connection is still active. Fixes bug 28912; bugfix on
      0.3.4.1-alpha. Patch by "cypherpunks3".
